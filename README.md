# traceCollect
open tutorial for strace/ltrace to collect system calls for program analysis


## Intro:
The software repository is here:
http://sir.unl.edu/portal/index.php

This is where we get all the experiment programs and test cases.

The data we are trying to get is the system call and library call traces when those programs are executed. 
strace(http://linux.die.net/man/1/strace) and ltrace(http://linux.die.net/man/1/ltrace) for recording that data. 


Of couse it's ok if you have other ways to do it.


### Disclaimer
All implementations are only research prototypes!
Please use it only for tests.
