The software repository is here:

This is where we get all the experiment programs and test cases. 

The data we are trying to get is the system call and library call traces when those programs are executed. 
I use strace(http://linux.die.net/man/1/strace) and ltrace(http://linux.die.net/man/1/ltrace) for recording that data.
